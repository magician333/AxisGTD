We do not collect any personal information from you. All of your tasks and data are stored locally on your browser, and no data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.\n\nTo enhance your user experience, AxisGTD utilizes your browser's local storage (indexedDB) to save your tasks and settings. This allows you to access your Todo list and settings across different sessions without the need to re-enter your information.\n\nWe do not ask for or store any personal information such as your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information (PII). The only data that is stored is related to your Todo tasks, which are not linked to your identity.\n\nSince your data is stored locally on your browser, we do not have access to it, and therefore, we do not have the ability to secure it from our end. It is your responsibility to ensure that your device and browser are secure.\n\nAxisGTD does not integrate with or use any third-party services that would require the sharing of your data. We are dedicated to keeping your information private and within your control.\n\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or in the services we offer.
