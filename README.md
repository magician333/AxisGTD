### Last Updated: May 21, 2024

At AxisGTD, we are committed to respecting the privacy of our users and their data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Todo task management service.

1. Data Collection and Use

AxisGTD is a client-side Todo management service that operates entirely within your browser. We do not collect any personal information from you. All of your tasks and data are stored locally on your browser, and no data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.

2. Browser Storage

To enhance your user experience, AxisGTD utilizes your browser's local storage(indexedDB) to save your todos and settings. This allows you to access your Todo list and settings across different sessions without the need to re-enter your information.

3. No Personal Information

We do not ask for or store any personal information such as your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information (PII). The only data that is stored is related to your Todo tasks, which are not linked to your identity.

4. Data Security

Since your data is stored locally on your browser, we do not have access to it, and therefore, we do not have the ability to secure it from our end. It is your responsibility to ensure that your device and browser are secure.

5. Third-Party Services

AxisGTD does not integrate with or use any third-party services that would require the sharing of your data. We are dedicated to keeping your information private and within your control.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or in the services we offer. The date of the last update will be clearly indicated at the beginning of the policy.

7. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at [insert contact email or method here]. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is maintained and your rights are respected.

Please note that this is a sample privacy policy and it's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure that it meets all legal requirements and accurately reflects your service's practices. Also, ensure that you include the appropriate contact information for users to reach out to you with any questions or concerns.
