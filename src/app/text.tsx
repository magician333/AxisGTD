                <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>
                    AxisGTD is a client-side Todo management service that operates entirely within your browser. We do not collect any personal information from you. All of your tasks and data are stored locally on your browser, and no data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.

                <h2>2. Browser Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    To enhance your user experience, AxisGTD utilizes your browser's local storage to save your tasks and settings. This allows you to access your Todo list and settings across different sessions without the need to re-enter your information.

                <h2>3. No Personal Information</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not ask for or store any personal information such as your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information (PII). The only data that is stored is related to your Todo tasks, which are not linked to your identity.

                <p>
                    Since your data is stored locally on your browser, we do not have access to it, and therefore, we do not have the ability to secure it from our end. It is your responsibility to ensure that your device and browser are secure.

                <p>
                    AxisGTD does not integrate with or use any third-party services that would require the sharing of your data. We are dedicated to keeping your information private and within your control.
